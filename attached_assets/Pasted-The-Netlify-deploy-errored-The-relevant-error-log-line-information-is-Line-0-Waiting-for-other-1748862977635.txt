Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

**Diagnosis:**
The build is failing at the `build.command` step with the error `bash: line 1: cd: client: No such file or directory` because it cannot find the `client` directory.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the `client` directory exists in your project repository.
2. If the `client` directory exists in your repository, ensure that it is committed and available in the correct location.
3. Update the `build.command` in your `netlify.toml` configuration file to `npm run build` or adjust it to the correct path based on the directory structure of your project.
