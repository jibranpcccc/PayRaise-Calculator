Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed due to the absence of the `terser` package, which has become an optional dependency since Vite v3.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the `terser` package is listed in the `package.json` file or that it was committed to the repository.
2. Install the `terser` package by running the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install terser
   ```
3. Retry the build after ensuring the `terser` package is installed.
