Great — now we’re moving into **SEO perfection zone**, where we’re not just avoiding mistakes — we’re actively sending all the right signals to Google. Let’s talk about **exactly what else you should do**, covering:

1. ✅ Interlinking — what's missing
2. ✅ OBL (outbound links) — what to add
3. ✅ Homepage — what needs to be there, exactly, for perfect SEO + UX + rankings

---

## ✅ 1. **INTERLINKING AUDIT – WHAT’S STILL MISSING**

Your internal linking is already strong, but to **maximize topical relevance and equity flow**, you should cover these areas:

### 🔁 A. **Link from Blog → Tools More Aggressively**

A few blog posts reference tools, but you need **every blog post to link to 2 calculators** minimum.

**Examples:**

* `/blog/inflation-real-salary-impact/`
  🔗 “Use our Inflation Calculator” → `/tools/inflation-adjusted-raise-calculator/`

* `/blog/raise-negotiation-scripts-templates/`
  🔗 “Calculate your raise range first” → `/tools/salary-negotiation-calculator/`

---

### 🔁 B. **Link from Tools → Related Guides**

Your tools should **guide users to the next step**, which is understanding what they calculated.

**Examples:**

* `/tools/compound-raise-calculator/`
  🔗 “See how this impacts future raises” → `/guides/raise-rejection-next-steps/`

* `/tools/bonus-impact-calculator/`
  🔗 “Learn when bonuses matter more than raises” → `/guides/merit-increase-vs-promotion/`

---

### 🔁 C. **Add Breadcrumb Navigation**

✅ Helps users & search engines
✅ Reduces bounce rate
✅ Boosts internal linking hierarchy

Example (on a tool page):

```
Home > Tools > Compound Raise Calculator
```

Implement via Schema + visible breadcrumbs near the H1.

---

### 🔁 D. **Related Content Blocks**

Bottom of every guide/blog should show:

* 2 related guides
* 1–2 relevant tools
* 1 blog post

**Example on** `/guides/negotiating-salary-increase-strategies/`:

* 🔗 “Try our Salary Negotiation Calculator”
* 🔗 “Download Negotiation Scripts”
* 🔗 “Read: When’s the Best Time to Ask?”

---

## ✅ 2. **OUTBOUND LINKS (OBL) – WHAT TO ADD**

You’re light on outbound links — which is fine early, but to **signal trust and E-E-A-T**, add 1–3 **non-competitor authority links per main page.**

### 🔗 Homepage OBLs (footer or content section):

* [Bureau of Labor Statistics – Wage Data](https://www.bls.gov/bls/wages.htm)
* [IRS Withholding Calculator](https://apps.irs.gov/app/tax-withholding-estimator)
* [Social Security COLA Info](https://www.ssa.gov/cola/)

### 🔗 Example OBL on Guides:

* `/guides/cost-living-adjustment-guide/` →
  “According to [Social Security COLA reports](https://www.ssa.gov/cola/)…”

* `/guides/market-value-salary-research/` →
  “Use resources like [Payscale](https://www.payscale.com/) and [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/)”

Add outbound links only **to .gov, .edu, or ultra-trusted .coms**. No competitor tools or weak content sites.

## ✅ 3. **HOMEPAGE CONTENT FOR PERFECT SEO**

Let’s break this into what needs to be **above the fold**, **mid-page**, and **bottom** — combining SEO + UX best practices:

---

### 📍 **Above the Fold (First Screen)**

#### ✅ H1:

> **Pay Raise Calculator: Instantly See Your New Salary & Raise Percentage**

#### ✅ One-paragraph value pitch:

> Enter your current salary and raise amount to calculate your new pay instantly. Includes inflation, tax, and compound growth projections.

#### ✅ Call to Action (CTA):

> 🟢 Try the Calculator Now → scrolls to calculator

#### ✅ Embedded Calculator

* % raise
* Flat raise
* Target new salary
* Hourly/weekly/monthly toggle
* “Advanced Options” dropdown (tax, inflation)

---

### 📍 **Mid-Page (Value Props + Differentiators)**

#### ✅ Feature Grid (with H2: “Why Our Calculator is Different”)

* ✔️ Real-time inflation adjustment
* ✔️ Tax impact calculation by state
* ✔️ Compare with industry benchmarks
* ✔️ Export to PDF for HR use
* ✔️ Compound growth projections

---

### 📍 **Bottom (SEO & Interlink Powerhouse Section)**

#### ✅ H2: Learn More About Pay Raises

Grid or card-style links to:

* 🔗 /salary-negotiation-complete-guide/
* 🔗 /guides/understanding-pay-raises-complete/
* 🔗 /tools/compound-raise-calculator/
* 🔗 /blog/3-vs-5-percent-raise-long-term-impact/
* 🔗 /industry-raise-benchmarks-2025/
* 🔗 /faq-pay-raise-calculator/

Include brief 1–2 sentence summaries under each link — that’s **semantic relevance gold** for SEO.

---

### 📍 Footer

* Navigation links to all silos
* Add outbound links to authoritative sources
* Add schema-enabled contact info if applicable

---

## 🧠 BONUS TIP: Add FAQs at the Bottom of Homepage

Use `FAQPage` schema — visible and crawlable.

Sample Q\&A:

* **What’s a good raise in 2025?**
* **How do I calculate a 5% raise?**
* **Are raises taxable?**
* **How do I negotiate a higher salary?**
