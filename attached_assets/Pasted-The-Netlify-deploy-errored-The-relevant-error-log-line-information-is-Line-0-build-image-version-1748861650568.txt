Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

### Diagnosis
The build failed with the following error:
- Line 76: `Could not resolve entry module "client/index.html".`

### Solution
1. The error indicates that the build couldn't find the entry module `client/index.html`.
2. Ensure that the entry module path is correctly configured in the Vite configuration.
3. Verify that the `client/index.html` file is present in the correct location and has been committed to the repository.
4. Update the Vite configuration to point to the correct path for the entry module.
5. After verifying the file path and making necessary adjustments, trigger a new build to check if the issue has been resolved.
