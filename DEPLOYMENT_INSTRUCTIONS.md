# Complete Deployment Instructions

Your PayRaise Calculator is ready for deployment. Here are the exact steps for both hosting options:

## Option 1: Netlify Deployment (Recommended)

### Upload to GitHub:
1. Upload these updated files to your GitHub repository:
   - `netlify.toml` (deployment configuration)
   - `client/package.json` (client dependencies)
   - All existing files

### Deploy on Netlify:
1. Go to netlify.com and sign in
2. Click "Import from Git" â†’ Select your GitHub repository
3. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Node version: 18
4. Click "Deploy site"

Your website will be live at: `your-site-name.netlify.app`

## Option 2: cPanel Deployment

### Build Static Files:
1. Run in your local development environment:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

### Upload to cPanel:
1. Compress the `dist` folder as a ZIP file
2. In cPanel File Manager, navigate to `public_html`
3. Upload and extract the ZIP file
4. Ensure these files are in `public_html`:
   - `index.html`
   - `assets/` folder
   - `sitemap.xml`
   - `robots.txt`

## Database Configuration (For Dynamic Features)

If you want database functionality:
1. Set up a MySQL database in cPanel
2. Update connection strings in your hosting provider
3. Run database migrations

## Static vs Dynamic Deployment

**Static Deployment (Recommended for now):**
- All 57+ pages work perfectly
- Calculators function with client-side logic
- No database required
- Faster loading times
- Works on any hosting provider

**Dynamic Deployment (Advanced):**
- Requires Node.js hosting
- Database connectivity
- Server-side functionality

## Post-Deployment Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] All calculator tools work
- [ ] Navigation between pages functions
- [ ] Sitemap.xml is accessible
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] SEO meta tags display properly

Your website includes:
- 19 Interactive Calculators

The static version will work perfectly for most use cases and can be upgraded to dynamic later if needed.
