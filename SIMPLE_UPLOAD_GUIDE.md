## What You'll Do:
1. Download files from Replit
2. Upload to GitHub in one go
3. Deploy your website

## Step 1: Download Everything from Replit
From your Replit workspace, download these:
- The entire workspace as a ZIP file (use Replit's download option)
- OR download these specific folders: `client`, `server`, `shared`, `public`
- Plus these files: `package.json`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, config files

## Step 2: Upload to GitHub (One Action)
1. Go to: https://github.com/jibranpcccc/PayRaise-Calculator
2. Click: "uploading an existing file" 
3. Drag and drop ALL downloaded files and folders
4. Type commit message: "Complete PayRaise Calculator website"
5. Click "Commit changes"

## Step 3: Deploy Your Website
After GitHub upload:
- Go to vercel.com
- Click "Import Project"
- Select your GitHub repository
- Add DATABASE_URL in environment variables
- Click "Deploy"

## Your Website Contains:
- 19 Interactive Calculators
- 14 Expert Guides  
- 24 Blog Articles
- Complete Database Integration
- Mobile Responsive Design
- SEO Optimization

Total: 57+ pages ready for live deployment

## Alternative: Use GitHub's Web Editor
If bulk upload doesn't work:
1. Use GitHub's "Create new file" option
2. Upload folders one by one
3. Start with the most important: `client/`, `server/`, `package.json`

Your website is production-ready and will work immediately after upload.
